# Terra Magna - 0 A.D. Civilization Mod

Terra Magna mod adds new civilizations to the free and open source real-time strategy game [0 A.D.](https://play0ad.com/) The following civilizations are added by the mod:

- Han China
- Zapotecs

The Terra Magna mod was formerly known as [Rise of the East](http://www.moddb.com/mods/rote). A new name for the mod was necessary after we added the Zapotec and Kushite civilization. Therefore, the Terra Magna mod is a continuation of the Rise of the East mod with extended content.

### Han China

Adds [Han China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty) as faction to 0 A.D. The Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) was the second great imperial dynasty of China. Preceded by the Qin dynasty (221 - 207 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220 - 280 AD). The Han dynasty lasted over four centuries. It is considered a golden age in Chinese history, because China made significant progress in arts and sciences during the Han period.

### Zapotecs

Adds the [Zapotec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization) faction to 0 A.D.

## Download

{Will be added after the transition and migration of the Rise of the East mod is finished.}

There is only one download option for every version, because the same mod can work across all platforms 0 A.D. can run on. This means you only need one ZIP file regardless if you are using Windows, Linux or macOS.

## Installation

{Will be added after the transition and migration of the Rise of the East mod is finished.}
